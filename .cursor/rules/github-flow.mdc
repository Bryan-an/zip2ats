description: GitHub Flow branching strategy
globs:
  - '**/*'

Follow GitHub Flow methodology:

## Branches
Format: `<type>/<description>`

Types:
- feature/ - new features
- fix/ - bug fixes
- chore/ - maintenance, dependencies, setup
- docs/ - documentation
- refactor/ - code restructuring
- test/ - tests
- perf/ - performance improvements

Rules:
- lowercase only
- use hyphens for spaces
- descriptive but concise
- branch from main, merge to main

## Workflow
1. Create branch from main
2. Commit often (conventional commits)
3. Push and open PR
4. Review, test, merge
5. Delete branch after merge
6. Deploy from main

Keep main always deployable.
