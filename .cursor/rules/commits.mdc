description: Auto-select best commit type and message
globs:
  - '**/*'
---

When making commits, automatically choose the most appropriate type and descriptive message based on the changes:
- feat: new features
- fix: bug fixes
- docs: documentation changes
- style: formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- refactor: code restructuring without changing behavior
- test: adding or updating tests
- chore: build config, gitignore, dependencies, etc.

Always create descriptive, concise commit messages in English.
